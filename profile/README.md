# Andover Village Improvement Society

Founded in 1894 as The Andover Village Improvement Society, AVIS is one of the oldest land conservation organizations in the country. AVIS manages more than 30 reservations comprising more than 1,200 acres in the Town of Andover. It relies on a corps of volunteers to lead the organization and to provide maintenance of its recreational trails and stewardship for the land and its wildlife habitat. Donations from community members and grant sources provide the funds to acquire, protect and manage its reservations.
